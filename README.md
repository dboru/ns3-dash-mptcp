#ns-3.19 with MPTCP and MPEG-DASH. 
That's a ready-to-use distro with built-in support for MPTCP and MPEG-DASH. All the due credit goes to the work of guys from University of Sussex (for MPTCP implementation [1]) and Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt (for DASH [2]). I just slightly extended those two models such that they build and work together without issues. 

##How to build:
First go into **AMuSt-libdash-master/**, read its README and build the libdash for ns-3.

Next, make sure you have all ns-3 dependencies **and** ZLib dev packages.

Then you can go to **ns3/** and configure it:

    ./waf configure --with-dash=../AMuSt-libdash-master/libdash/ --enable-tests --disable-python

...and build it as usual.

##How to use
Feel free to check scripts in **ns3/scratch/** for examples on how to use.
